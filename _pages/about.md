Environmental injustice persists and is observable from space.

Sustainable and consequential action can begin with systematic aggregation of evidence and improved measurement of negative wellbeing outcomes for people and damage to the planet

Decision making is less biased and more just when individual experience and marginalized voices are included in scientifically valid processes.

Open Science broadens participation in the scientific process with tangible benefits of increased value for money, faster innovation, and equitable policy response.

Perhaps most importantly for policy impact, Open Science inclusion of the private sector, public entities, academia and citizens builds common trust in the evidence that informs decisions and policy dialogues.

The synoptic observational power of NASA data products to address domestic challenges remains largely underutilized even as it has played a decades long role in global monitoring of Earth system changes.

Increased temporal and spatial resolution of NASA data streams make previous research on global issues like climate change now tractable for decision support at more local levels.

The resilience of the Louisiana Gulf Coast with a broad diversity of communities facing a wide-range of environmental challenges could potentially benefit the most as well as provide real world assessment of opportunities for value addition to NASA investments with greater inclusive and equitable engagement in Open Science.
