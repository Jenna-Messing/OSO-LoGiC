Overview
======

Environmental injustice persists because it too often goes unobserved. Individual complaints and marginalized voices too often lack scientifically valid processes that can aggregate evidence for sustainable and consequential action. 

Open Science broadens participation in the scientific process with tangible benefits of increased value for money, faster innovation, and equitable policy response. Open Science inclusion of the private sector, public entities, academia and citizens builds common trust in the evidence that informs decisions and policy dialogues. 

The resilience of the Louisiana Gulf Coast with a broad diversity of communities facing a wide-range of environmental challenges could potentially benefit the most as well as provide real world assessment of opportunities for value addition to NASA investments with greater inclusive and equitable engagement in Open Science.

The OSO-LOGIC is part of the NASAâ€™s newest initiative element of the Earth Sciences Division (ESD) to advance equity by focusing programmatically on underserved communities, redoubling efforts to understand domestic impacts of environmental and climate change, and intentionally promote diversity, inclusion and accessibility.
