      <summary> <font size="+3">Stormy weather: June 20-21, 2021 </font> <br>
      The SUNRISE Cruise began with some bad weather and a lot of seasickness. It didn’t
      sound too bad in the forecasts - 30 knot winds with 5 foot waves at a period of 5
      seconds - but for relatively small boats like the RV Pelican and RV Walton Smith, we
      really felt it. Almost everybody was seasick to some extent, but people powered through
      and we started sampling. <u> Read More! </u> </summary> <br>

      First with just the ship’s flow through system and ADCPs, then
      we added the CT chains, and finally started VMPing. By that team, we were gradually
      feeling better and better - getting our ‘sea legs.’ <br>

      <br> I’m always impressed by my friends and colleagues on the ship - such difficult
      conditions to work in and so much effort put into getting the work done. I am fortunate
      and grateful to be surrounded by such amazing people. <br>

      spouts at us … I’ve never seen a water spout in person before. It was a pretty ominous
      sight. There was also a lot of thunder and lightning during this period.</font>

     <summary>   <font size="+3">Chilling with Claudette: June 18, 2021 </font> <br>
      The SUNRISE science team  arrived at the LUMCON facility hoping for an efficient load-out. We are sailing on two ships, the R/V Pelican operated by LUMCON and the R/V Walton Smith operated by  RSMAS.   The plan was for the Walton Smith to load and depart first and do some scouting near our planned operational area, and then the Pelican would come out and join. However, as with many best laid fieldwork plans, Nature had other ideas.  <u> Read More! </u> </summary> <br>

      Tropical Depression Claudette arrived on the scene (first photo below). In anticipation of the storm surge and associated flooding, both ships were moved 25 miles inland through a really interesting series of inland canals and waterways, to Houma LA.   We managed to mobilize all our gear and people there, and appreciated the can-do attitude of both the LUMCON staff and the crews of both ships to get things done.  After installing and testing some of our equipment, we finally set sail Sunday morning.  Seas are a little big out here following the storm, but hopefully are calming down soon. Stay tuned for more about the different instruments we are using, the respective ships, the science questions we are excited to explore and hopefully some data! <br>
